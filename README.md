###### Softwareprojekt Geosoftware II - WWU MÃ¼nster - Gruppe 4


### Installation:

##### System Requirements:
In theory, the software should run on any Linux-based server system.
Only the installation of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 LTS is described as only this system was tested.

    1. MongoDB has to be installed. Recommended here is at least version 3, an installation guide 
       can be found at https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu

    2. R with the normal basic packages is needed. This is Ubuntu package r-base.
       In addition, the R-packages r-gdal and xts must be installed.

    3. Node.JS has to be installed. It is recommended to use at least version 4 LTS.

    4. LatexML has to be installed. At least version 8.1 is required because only from this version
       adequate HTML can be generated.
       To install, the guide "Installing tarball" (http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/get.html) was used,
       first, however, under "Installing prerequisites" section (for Ubuntu under "Debian-based systems")
       packages must be installed.

    5. The package manager bower must be installed. This can be done via sudo npm install -g bower.

    6. Last you need to install the project itself. Therefore one must go to the directory and run
      "npm install" and "bower install".

With node Server.js one starts the server, which is available under port 8080.
