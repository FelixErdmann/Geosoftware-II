  - Behind this tag you have to insert the file name with the appropriate file extension
  - An Example: If you want to insert a .tif file in your LaTeX file, then you have to include this: ":!:myImage.tif" 
    at the appropriate spot in your LaTeX code.

  - Once authenticated, you can click the Publish Button for uploading your own paper.
  - In the window that opens, you can give your paper a title, add the authors name and choose the actual date
    for your publication.

    - RData files for time series (as zoo or xts objects) and
